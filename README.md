# wireframing
introduction
In most cases, as a frontend developer in software development, you will receive a complete set of mockup designs from the UI/UX design team. These designs are usually well thought out, providing you with an idea of what the end product will look like and all the assets you will need for implementing the UI.

There are several wireframing tools available, most of which use the same underlying concepts. Figma is a great tool. Letâ€™s take a moment to understand some wireframing basics.

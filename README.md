# wireframing
introduction
In most cases, as a frontend developer in software development, you will receive a complete set of mockup designs from the UI/UX design team. These designs are usually well thought out, providing you with an idea of what the end product will look like and all the assets you will need for implementing the UI.

There are several wireframing tools available, most of which use the same underlying concepts. Figma is a great tool. Letâ€™s take a moment to understand some wireframing basics.

Key Elements in a Wireframe
Layout Structure: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.
Navigation: Shows how users will move through the site or application.
Content Placement: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
Functionality: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.
Types of Wireframes

Low-Fidelity vs. High-Fidelity Wireframes

Low-fidelity wireframes are simple, rough sketches or basic digital layouts used early in the design process. They focus on the structure, layout, and general placement of elements without any detailed visuals or real content. These wireframes are quick and inexpensive to create, making them ideal for brainstorming sessions, early feedback, and rapid iterations. They often use placeholders for images and text and rely on basic shapes to represent different components of a page. Tools like pen and paper, Balsamiq, or wireframe.cc are commonly used for creating low-fidelity wireframes.

On the other hand, high-fidelity wireframes are detailed and closely resemble the final product. They include real or representative content, precise spacing, branding elements like colors and fonts, and often interactive features such as clickable buttons or hover effects. High-fidelity wireframes are typically used later in the design process for usability testing, client presentations, or developer handoff. They require more time and resources to build and are often created using professional design tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch.

In summary, low-fidelity wireframes help quickly translate ideas into basic visual forms, while high-fidelity wireframes refine those ideas into a nearly finished design that can be tested and shared with stakeholders. Both serve important roles at different stages of the design workflow.
